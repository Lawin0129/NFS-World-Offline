# About NFS: World
Need for Speed: World was originally released in 2010 and shutdown in 2015.
It was a multiplayer racing game that was published by Electronic Arts and co-developed by EA Black Box. It was the first freemium MMORG (Massively Multiplayer Online Racing Game) in the Need for Speed franchise and was available on Windows. The game combined gameplay elements from previous titles in the series, such as NFS: Most Wanted and NFS: Carbon, with MMO features. It focused on illegal street racing, car tuning, and police chases, and was set in a map called Tri-City, which was a combination of Rockport and Palmont cities from previous games.
